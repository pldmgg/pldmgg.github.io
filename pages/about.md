My name's Paul DiMaggio. Some folks call me an Infrastructure Architect/Engineer, others call me a DevOps Engineer. At the end of the day, I design IT infrastructure, write code to automate infratructure builds, and manage/maintain configuration via popular Configuration Management solutions. I'm proficient with Python and Ruby (in an OpsCode Chef context), but my favorite tools are PowerShell and C#. I work with AWS and Azure regularly, and I'm also a huge fan of Hashicorp's suite of products.

In my 20s, I did a lot of IT Security work for the US Federal Government, both as a federal employee and working for a couple of well-known defense contractors. I've spent the past couple of years really sharpening my skills with PowerShell and C#, to the point where I actually feel comfortable starting a blog :). At present, I'm in my early 30s, living in Philadelphia, PA, and trying to start a small business.

I'm currently looking for small infrastructure projects (1-3 month commitment) primarily as a way to build healthy business relationships in my area and beyond (if remote work is acceptable).

I'm very active on Reddit's [/r/powershell](https://www.reddit.com/r/powershell) subreddit (I go by /u/fourierswager), and while social media hasn't really been very attractive to me over the years, I'm trying to get into Twitter. If you'd like to reach out to me, please send me a Direct Message [https://twitter.com/pldmgg](https://twitter.com/pldmgg).
